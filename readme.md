This project is focused on a analyzing the Los Angles Metro Bike Share
data. This operation provides rental bicycles 365 days a year since the 2d quarter
of 2016. During this period, four regions in Los Angeles were served:
1. Downtown LA,
2. The Port of LA
3. Venice, and
4. Pasadena.
Metro Bike Share plan to expand their operations into other areas of Los Angeles.
The primary focus is on predicting the number of bicycles needed at each station, evaluating the pricing
system currently used to make recommendations for possible pricing changes and
expanding the network. A key question is how to manage bicycle staging to meet
demand, and where to look opportunities to expand into new regions in the LA
basin.
Statistical models are developed for forecasting demand for the coming month. From this, recommendations are prepared for:
1. Managing bicycle staging at the 140+ rental stations,
2. Forecasting income from ticket sales on a monthly basis for each region,
and make recommendations for possible pricing modifications.
3. Identify key characteristics that identify whether a region will be successful
in the future by evaluating the four regions found in these data.
